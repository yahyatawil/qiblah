# This Project
An open-source qibla finder with tilt compensation using 9-DoF IMU and GPS connected with Arduino.

## Features

The Qiblah project features are:
- Determining the Qibla using the magnetometer and/or the GPS receiver in case the circuit is likely to move for long distances.
- Tilt compensation.
- Magnetometer calibration.
- Open source for non-commercial purposes.
- Built with public and available circuits and easy to rebuild.
- Well documented.

## Hardware
  - Arduino board.
  - BMI270 shuttle board.
  - Adafruit Mini GPS PA1010D.
  - Monochrome 0.91" 128x32 I2C OLED Display.
